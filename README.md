7. Ask Max for the API keys you need to use the Twitter API. Put what he gives you in a new `.env` file in this repository.

**If you are not in the Bits of Good Bootcamp, you will have to request access to the [Twitter API](http://developer.twitter.com/) yourself.**

Once when you have access, put the API keys that Twitter gives you in the `.env` file using the following format:

```
CONSUMER_KEY=abcdef...
CONSUMER_SECRET=abcdef...
ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=abcdef...
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=abcdef...
```
